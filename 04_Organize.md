# Organizing and Assesing Work
Before you can do any work you have to identify the work. You were provided with an excel workbook to create the test conditions, input values, and test cases and a word document with requirements for the webpage you will be testing. There are four worksheets, three worksheets will require you to fill them out: 

- Conditions Table
- Condition Input Values
- Registration Test Cases

Aside from completing these worksheets, you will have to develop the automation of test cases. 

I suggest you first try to list what needs to be done
