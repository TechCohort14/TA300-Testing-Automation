# Testing and Automation

NFAR is gearing up for its Annual Race and we need to you to test the new online registration form. Unfortunately most of the requirements used to build the website were lost in a system crash. We were lucky that we had a back up of the code in GitHub ðŸ˜Š. The website is back up and is ready for System testing. The product owner had a backup of the requirements for the registration page, so it will be provided for you to use as test basis.

You goal is to use your ISTQB knowledge to create test conditions, test cases, and a test suite. Using WebDriverIO create a test suite for the registration form.  The website page you will be testing is included in the test
 
As in most projects, you will work in teams to get this done. You will be sharing the work and relying on each other to get the work done. It is a collaborative process. We will have stand up meetings every week to measure progress, create action items, and identify any roadblocks you may be having. Are you ready?   

# Create an Organization
While GitHub is essentially used for repositories, it has several other features. One of them is [Organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations). Please follow link, read the article and then come back.  

Now that you have an idea of what a GitHub organization is, go ahead and discuss in your team what to name your Organization (please note that it must be a name used in a professional setting). Once you decide the name of the organization (you must review team name with project manager), one team member will [create](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) it.  

After your organization is created you will [invite](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization) the other team members to join. They should accept the invitaion to join the organization. 

Once you have done these steps, you should have an organization and your team members should be part of it

## Create a Repository
Now that you have your organization set up, you need a repository in order to share your work. One team member will create a repository within the organization (you can create the repository directly on GitHub). Once this team member creates the repository, they will make sure the other team member is able to clone it. 

In the repository you will maintain your test conditions and any other test material in one folder (named **testMaterial**). The other folder (test) will be created automatically when you install WebdriverIO (later on, not now). In it you will find folders for page objects and test specs. The test basis to develop your test conditions and test cases will be emailed to you. 

 At this point you should have: 
 - GitHub Organization
 - Team members are part of the organization
 - Repository with following folders:
   - testMaterial
- Everyone on the team will clone the above repository, create a branch, and test they can push to their branch of the repository.
