# Testing and Automation

NFAR is gearing up for its Annual Race and we need to you to test the new online registration form. Unfortunately most of the requirements used to build the website were lost in a system crash. We were lucky that we had a back up of the code in GitHub ðŸ˜Š. The website is back up and is ready for System testing. The product owner had a backup of the requirements for the registration page, so it will be provided for you to use as test basis.

You goal is to use your ISTQB knowledge to create test conditions, test cases, and a test suite. Using WebDriverIO create a test suite for the registration form.  The website page you will be testing is included in the test
 
As in most projects, you will work in teams to get this done. You will be sharing the work and relying on each other to get the work done. It is a collaborative process. We will have stand up meetings every week to measure progress, create action items, and identify any roadblocks you may be having. Are you ready?   

# Create an Organization
WHile GitHub is essentially used for repositories, it has several other features. One of them is [Organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations). Please follow link and read the article. Then come back.  

Now that you have an idea of what an organization is, go ahead and decide on what your Organization name will be (please note that it must be a name used in a professional setting). Once you decide the name of the organization, one team member will create it.  

As a team you will need to create a repository in order to share your work. In the repository you will maintain your test conditions and any other test material in one folder (named testMaterial). The other folder (test) will be created automatically when you install WebdriverIO. In it you will find folders for page objects and test specs. The test basis to develop your test conditions and test cases will be emailed to you. 

One team member will create a repository.
