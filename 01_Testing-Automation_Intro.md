# Testing and Automation

NFAR is gearing up for its Annual Race and we need to you to test the new online registration form. Unfortunately most of the requirements that were used to build the website were lost in a system crash. We were lucky that we had a back up of the code in GitHub ðŸ˜Š. The website is back up and is ready for System testing. The product owner had a backup of the requirements for the registration page.

You are tasked to create a test suite using your ISTQB knowledge to create test conditions, test cases, and test suite. Using WebDriverIO create a test suite for the registration form.  The website page you will be testing is: https://nfar.rallybound.org/replicated/Account/Register 
 
As in most projects, you will work in teams to get this done. As a team you will be sharing the work and relying on each other to get the work done. It is a collaborative process. We will have stand up meetings every week to measure progress, create action items, and identify any roadblocks you may be having.   

# Create a Repository
As a team you will need a repository in order to share your work.
