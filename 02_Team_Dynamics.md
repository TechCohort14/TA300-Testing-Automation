# Working on a Team

Before we get any work done let's set the tone for the team dynamics. Starting off with a set of rules of how you will conduct yourself while on the team is a good idea. Here is an [article](https://blog.saberr.com/team-norms-behaviors) on it that would be helpful for you to read. We all have some basic understanding of how to behave in social situations and they may translate to the professinal setting. One thing is to socialize and another is the get work done.     

Please discuss with your team how you wish to address: 
- Work distribution
- Handling disagreements
- Meeting deadlines 
- Review process (establish a time/day to discuss and review work)
- Etc. 

A [sample team contract](SampleTeamContract.md) is provided to give you an idea.

Do not overlook this process. You will be presenting this at your first standup meeting.
