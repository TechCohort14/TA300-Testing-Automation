# Stand Up Meetings

You will have a stand up meeting on coding days. Stand up meetings will not take longer than 10 minutes (can take between 10-15). These meetings are meant for the team to touch base and answer three keys questions: 

- What did I work on yesterday?
- What am I working on today?
- What issues are blocking me?

We want to make sure that the work continues to move forward.
